# net use /connecter 

# Educational purposes only.

This is a simple batch file that will connect to PCs using net use.
It will ask for the following:
GitHub username
Password list 
Username
IP address

# How to give the connecter passwords on Windows 11:
Download the latest release, open password list.txt and enter the passwords or get the example password list.
Next, right click and click "Copy as path"
Go back into the program and paste.
Click enter.
It should go through the list.

# How to give the connecter passwords on Windows 10:
Do the same as Step 1 on Windows 11.
Drag the password list into the command line and make sure it's in this format "C:\Passwords.txt"
Click enter.
It should proceed.

# What is this made out of?

This is made out of batch and powershell. I remade 'ebola man's "SMB-Bruteforce" and fixed some errors.
The reason why it's so basic is mainly because I don't want to be in legal trouble.

# DISCLAIMERS:

Only use with permission.
You may need to turn off Windows Defender.
Modifying code is allowed, just go to "https://github.com/EbolaMan-YT/SMB-Bruteforce" and click "Code" then "Download ZIP".
The password list in the root of the project does not contain passwords. For a ready made example, go into "Example password list".
I won't be providing how to get IP addressses.
do not use this illegally. if used illegally, and you're in legal trouble, i may be involved.
And most importantly, educational purposes only :-)
